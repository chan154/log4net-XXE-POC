# Log4net XXE Demo (CVE-2018-1285)

This repository demonstrates a proof-of-concept exploit for [CVE-2018-1285](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1285), affecting **Apache log4net** prior to `v2.0.10`. It specifically shows how XML External Entity (XXE) injection can occur when parsing log4net configuration files.

> **Warning**  
> - This demo is for **educational and testing** purposes **only**.  
> - Do **not** use this against any system you do not own or have explicit permission to test.  
> - The provided example is intentionally **vulnerable** and should **never** be used in production.  
> - Upgrade to **log4net v2.0.10+** or later to mitigate this vulnerability.

## Overview

- **Vulnerability**: [CVE-2018-1285](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1285)  
- **Affected Component**: log4net versions before `2.0.10`  
- **Type of Exploit**: XML External Entity (XXE)  
- **Impact**: Potentially read arbitrary files from the filesystem or even conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF), depending on the XML parser settings and environment.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Visual Studio 2015** (though any version of Visual Studio that targets **.NET Framework 4** should work)  
- **log4net 1.2.10** (the vulnerable version)  
- A Windows machine (the demo references `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`)

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository.  
2. **Open the solution** (`Log4NetXXEDemo.sln`) in **Visual Studio 2015**.  
3. Right-click the **References** node in **Solution Explorer**, then **Add Reference...**.
   - Select **Browse** and add your **log4net.dll (v1.2.10)** file.  
4. In **Solution Explorer**, select `log4net.config`. In its **Properties**, set **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy if newer** (or **Copy always**).

---

## How to Run

1. Build the solution in Debug or Release mode.
2. Run the console app using Ctrl + F5 (Start Without Debugging) or from a Command Prompt.
3. In the console output, you should see:

---

## Mitigation
- Upgrade to log4net 2.0.10+ which disables XML external entities by default.
- Do not accept or load untrusted log4net configuration files.
- If you must parse external XML, ensure you set safe parser settings (e.g., disable DtdProcessing or set XmlResolver = null).

---

## Troubleshooting

- - Console Closes Immediately: Make sure you run the app without debugging (Ctrl+F5) or include Console.ReadKey() so you can see the output.
- - Attribute Value Error: If you see XmlException: attribute values must not contain direct or indirect entity references to external entities, it means .NETâ€™s XML parser is blocking the entity in an attribute. The above configuration places it in element content specifically to avoid that.
- - No XXE Expansion:
      - Confirm your log4net version is 1.2.10.
      - Ensure log4net.config is copied to the output directory.
      - Try referencing a different local file with simpler permissions (e.g., /path/test.txt).
